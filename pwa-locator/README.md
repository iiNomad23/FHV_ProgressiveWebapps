# pwa-locator

This web app is the starting point for the exercise "Locator" which is part of my course "Progressive WebApps" held at FH Vorarlberg. The finished app shall show a map of your environment with you current position marked. Locator will let you take pictures, which are also marked on the map.

Locator uses the following open source contributions:

* the [Leaflet library](https://leafletjs.com) to implement interactive maps;
* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) to get map data;
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) as a build tool;
* [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com) for beautiful, professional SVG icons.
